Inline Editing
--------------

The inline editor provides an efficient way to make changes to your content from the front end, without searching for that content in the CMS. When you visit the front end of your site while logged into Brightspot, there will be a label in the top left corner of each module. Click the label to be linked directly to that page's Content Edit page in Brightspot.
