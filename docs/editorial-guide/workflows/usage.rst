Using the Workflow
------------------

Once a Workflow is in place, status options will be available to all users as they create new content. Update roles on the Users & Roles page to restrict the available actions.

In the following example Workflow, the user role can be adjusted to permit only submission and deny approval or publishing.

The Published Drafts dashboard widget shows all content with a specific status. Click into content to show the available actions and notes.
