Focal Points are the easiest way to crop an image for multiple uses. With the Focus tab selected in the Edit Image interface, click the location in the image that you'd like to emphasize in your crops. A yellow bullseye will appear in the selected location.
When you switch to the Sizes & Texts tab to pick a crop, Brightspot will automatically align the crop options to make your Focal Point the center of the image while adhering the aspect ratio of the selected crop. If you choose to manually alter the crop, the changes only apply to the currently selected Standard Image Size.
