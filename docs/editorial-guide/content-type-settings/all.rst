======================

In the Content Types section of the Admin tab, you can customize the order and naming of content in the CMS.

Renaming Content Types

To rename a content type, select the content type from the list on the left side of the page, and change the Display Name field to update the name. In the example below, the Article content type has been renamed Blog Post.

Reordering Fields
-----------------

After selecting a content type to edit, modify its settings by changing the display name or reposition the fields by dragging and dropping them into a new order.

Creating Tabs
-------------

Organize your content by grouping fields together in tabs. To do this, click into a field and add a name for a tab. Each field using that name will appear in the tab. Tags and Keywords are added to a new tab area called Extras.
