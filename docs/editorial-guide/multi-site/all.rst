Multi-Site
==========

With Multi-Site, you can run multiple sites from one instance of Brightspot. In Multi-Site implementations, the label **Site: Global** will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, next to **History**. Click on the site label to open a drop-down menu to switch between sites. Content created or modified when the CMS is set to **Global** will apply to all sites. If you choose a specific site, created or modified content will only apply to the site you have selected. You can assigned Workflows to a specific site, or make them apply generally.

When you add or edit content in the Content Edit pane, you can choose the owner of the content with the Sites widget on the right side of the screen. The Sites widget contains two drop-down menus: the first selects a site owner, the second shares access to the content with other sites. Select "None" to make content available to all sites.

Site Categories
---------------

For large Multi-Site implementations, you can collect your sites into Categories. Create a Site Category by clicking **New Site Category** in the Site Categories widget. Give your new Category a name, and use the Contextual Search to add existing sites to the Category or to create new sites.

Your Categories will be listed in the Site Categories widget. When you click the site label drop-down, you'll now be able to choose a Category to see a list of relevant sites, and your searches will be filtered to the selected category.

From the Dashboard tab, you can customize the placement of widgets to suit your workflow. Create a new Dashboard by clicking the drop-down and selecting Set. From here, you can create multiple columns to organize the widgets on your Dashboard. Click the Add buttons for the widgets you'd like to place in each column. Set the width of each column by entering a number in the Width field. Column width are relative to one another, so a column with a width of 3 is three times the width of a 1 column. To make all columns equally wide, assign them each a width of 0.

When your Dashboard configuration is complete, click Save. To restore your Dashboard to the default configuration and discard your customizations, go back to the Dashboard tab and select None instead of Set.
