Getting Started with Brightspot Tutorials
-----------------------------------------

This series of tutorials shows you how to develop a web application using the Brightspot platform. The tutorials progress incrementally, introducing you to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, the Brightspot development workflow, standard content types, and key technologies, services, and subsystems. (For more information about MVVM, see `Model–view–viewmodel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel>`_.) The goal of the tutorials is to not only build a basic Brightspot web application, but to also point out more advanced concepts, services, and technologies that are used in the development of a production-grade web application.

These tutorials are accompanied by the Brightspot Tutorial Application, available from a GitHub repository. After installing and starting the Tutorial Application, you are ready to start the tutorials.
 
As you work through each tutorial in your development environment, the Brightspot reloader automatically compiles and redeploys your code, allowing for instantaneous review in the dashboard.
